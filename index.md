## Allow Me To Introduce Myself

Hi! My name is Payton, and I am (at time of writing) a 23 year old undergraduate Computer Science student at Weber State University. I'm excited to tell you more about me, but I must warn you, I am a certified list-enjoyer, and I will not apologize for that. 

Here is a picture of me in my natural habitat:![I don't know how to describe this.](NaturalHabitat.jpg)<sub>The Stewart library</sub>
